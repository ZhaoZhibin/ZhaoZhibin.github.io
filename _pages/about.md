* I am currently an assistant professor in the [School of Mechanical Engineering](http://mec.xjtu.edu.cn/) 
at [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://www.xjtu.edu.cn/).
* I was a visiting Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science and the Center for Health Informatics at [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/)
advised by Prof. [David Wong](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/david.wong/) and Prof.
[David Clifton](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~davidc/).
* I received my Ph.D. Degree in the [School of Mechanical Engineering](http://mec.xjtu.edu.cn/) 
at [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://www.xjtu.edu.cn/), 
advised by Prof. [Shibin Wang](http://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/wangshibin2008) and 
Prof. [Xuefeng Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=h47O1xYAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).

* I received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://www.xjtu.edu.cn/).
My undergraduate research advisor is Prof. [Xuefeng Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=h47O1xYAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). 

## Research Interests
My research interests lie in the general area of signal processing and machine learning, particularly in sparse representation and deep learning,
as well as their applications in fault diagnosis, condition monitoring and healthcare.
